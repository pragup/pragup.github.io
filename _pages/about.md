I have graduated with a Doctorate in Applied Mathematics in May 2021 focused on combinatorial optimization / computational geometry problems. My biggest strength is <em>my 
ability to formulate hard problems</em> with <em>simpler but effective solutions</em>. I have worked in AI startup as a <strong>Machine Learning Research Scientist</strong>. I have creatively used 
mathematical tools to develop machine learning algorithms that are decentralized, computationally efficient, noise resilient, and low shot for in-house neuromorphic chip 
development. I currently working for drilling rig company H&P as <strong>Research scientist 2</strong>. Directional Drilling for oil and gas is similar to driving a car with only access to 
<em>the rearview mirror or back mirror</em>. This makes the problem quite challenging. I have developed mathematical tools to characterize various <em>drilling dynamics and dysfunctions</em>
to make drilling more efficient. The goal of my work is to develop new mathematical algorithms to characterize/quantify various operations during drilling to make it more efficient.
  
In my doctoral program goal was to characterize mathematical aspects of 3d printing as combinatorial optimization / computational geometry problems and develop efficient
algorithms with provable guarantees of performance and quality for <em>tool routing</em>. I have creatively used mathematical techniques from combinatorial and computational topology,
discrete optimization, computational complexity, graph theory, and computational geometry for theoretical results and to design and implement algorithms that can lead to
development of efficient <em>rule based AI techniques</em>.I have published articles in Symposium of Solid And Physical Modeling (SPM) and International Journal of Computational 
Geometry (IJCGA). I am still an active researcher in mathematics. 

I enjoy developing mathematical algorithms. Currently interested in <strong>discrete mathematics, computational geometry, machine learning/data science /signal processing /topological
 data analysis, computational topology, operations research/optimization problem /NP-hard proofs /approximation algorithms</strong>. 

It is a hobby for me to observe connections between objects.
