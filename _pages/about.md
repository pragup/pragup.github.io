I have a doctorate in Applied Mathematics from Washington State University under my advisor is Dr. Bala Krishnamoorthy. I use mathematical techniques from combinatorial
and computational topology, discrete optimization, computational complexity, graph theory, and computational geometry for theoretical results and to design and implement
efficient algorithms.
During my doctorate, I have worked on characterizing mathematical aspects of 3d printing / additive manufacturing and design efficient algorithms, and high dimensional 
data visualization and summarization using topological data analysis (TDA).
I am currently working as a research scientist in a start-up. We are developing next-generation machine learning algorithms based on neuromorphic computing, which is 
significantly more noise resilience, requires remarkably fewer data, and are more noise resilient compared to deep learning algorithms.

It is a hobby for me to observe connections between objects.  
“We all live in a world of multi-scale, although things can be different in each scale but they are all connected in one
way or another”.
