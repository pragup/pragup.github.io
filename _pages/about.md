I am a Doctorate student in Applied Mathematics under Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Washington State University. My advisor in Dr. Bala Krishnamoorthy. My research is mainly focused on combinatorial topology and discrete optimization in Additive Manufacturing. My thesis will be titled Efficient and Scalable Algorithms for Continuous path planning in additive manufacturing using Graphical Models. We are addressing the question of continous tool path planning by tackling problems related to geometry and tool path traversal. By using graphical models in tool path planning, we ensure the requisite mechanical properties by imposing appropriate constrains. 
The overall goal is to characterize the mathematical aspects of additive manufacturing problem and to develop efficient algorithms with provable guarantees of performance and quality for tool path planning.
