I am a Doctoral student in Applied Mathematics under Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Washington State University. My Ph.D. advisor is Dr. Bala Krishnamoorthy. 
I use mathematical techniques from combinatorial and computational topology, discrete optimization, computational complexity, graph theory, and computational geometry 
for theoretical results and to design and implement efficient algorithms.
One of the goal of my research is to characterize mathematical aspects of 3d printing / additive manufacturing and design efficient algorithms. Second, to develop generalized 
mapper tool for high dimensional data visualization using topological data analysis (TDA). 
I also enjoy machine learning  and distributed computing from algorithmic and programming prospective.  

It is a hobby for me to observe connections between objects.  
“We all live in a world of multi-scale, although things can be different in each scale but they are all connected in one way or another”.
