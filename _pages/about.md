I have graduated with a Doctorate in Applied Mathematics in May 2021 focused on combinatorial optimization / computational geometry problems. My biggest strength is *my*
*ability to formulate hard problems* with *simpler but effective solutions*. I have worked in AI startup as a *Machine Learning Research Scientist*. I have creatively used 
mathematical tools to develop machine learning algorithms that are decentralized, computationally efficient, noise resilient, and low shot for in-house neuromorphic chip 
development.

In my doctoral program goal was to characterize mathematical aspects of 3d printing as combinatorial optimization / computational geometry problems and develop efficient
algorithms with provable guarantees of performance and quality for *tool routing*. I have creatively used mathematical techniques from combinatorial and computational topology,
discrete optimization, computational complexity, graph theory, and computational geometry for theoretical results and to design and implement algorithms that can lead to
development of efficient *rule based AI techniques*.I have published articles in Symposium of Solid And Physical Model (SPM) and International Journal of Computational 
Geometry (IJCGA).

I am currently looking for new opportunities. I enjoy designing algorithms for *NP-hard Problems including machine learning*.   

It is a hobby for me to observe connections between objects.
