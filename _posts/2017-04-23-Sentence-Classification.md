ABSTRACT
----------
Convolution Neural Networks are typically used in computer vision problems like image classification. Most of the computer vision systems todays at its core are based on CNNs from photo tagging to self driving cars. 
However we are going to look at the application of CNNs in NLP(Natural Language Processing).

BACKGROUND
----------

### Natural Language Processing ###
* Natural language is designed to make human communication efficient. As a result,
    * We omit a lot of “common sense” knowledge, which we assume the hearer/reader possesses.
    * We keep a lot of ambiguities, which we assume the hearer/reader knows how to resolve.
* This makes EVERY step in NLP hard.
    * Ambiguity is a “killer”!
    * Common sense reasoning is pre-required.
