ABSTRACT
----------
Convolution Neural Networks are typically used in computer vision problems like image classification. Most of the computer vision systems todays at its core are based on CNNs from photo tagging to self driving cars. 
However we are going to look at the application of CNNs in NLP(Natural Language Processing).
