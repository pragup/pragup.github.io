I am currently working on a paper to build a new mathematical technique for Topological Data Analysis. I used this technique to build 
a TDA mapper tool. This post is to give basic intuition about the mapper. Mapper is used to get a higher-level understanding of the structure of the data.
It is used to visualize the shape of the data in higher dimensions. Given a mapper representation of $3$D point cloud (Points are uniformly distributed) 
belongs to a set of animals (horse, lion, cat, camel, elephant, flamingo). Each ball in the mapper represents a cluster and the edge between balls implies
 common points between corresponding clusters (*intuition not definition of the mapper*). 

Can we identify the head or legs or tail of the animals as features in a $3$D point cloud? 
In Animal $1$ mapper it is not difficult to identify legs and head. Further legs are quite long compared to the rest of the body. Similarly, in Animal $5$ mapper.
In Animal $2$, $6$ mappers we can identify legs, tail, and head. In Animal $6$ legs are small. Animal $3$ is obviously an elephant based on given choices whereas Animal $4$ 
is flamingo since I can only see $2$ legs in the mapper. Animals $1$, $2$, $5$, and $6$ are camel, lion, horse, and cat.

Mapper can be used to provide insights into high-dimensional data sets with specific patterns and data exploration purposes.
