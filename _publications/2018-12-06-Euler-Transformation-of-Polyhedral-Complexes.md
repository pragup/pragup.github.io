excerpt: 'We have developed an Euler Transformation algorithm that transforms an arbitrary planar graph G(i.e in R^2) to a planar graph G'=(V', E') where every vertex in V' has even degree. We have shown that this transformation preserve geometry and topology of the domain. Further, we also proved that mesh quality of G' is at most a constant factor off from the quality of G. As an immediate next step, we will extend the Euler transformation algorithm to arbitrary graph in R^3.'

We propose an Euler transformation that transforms a given d-dimensional cell complex K for d=2,3 into a new d-complex K^ in which every vertex is part of a uniform even number of edges. Hence every vertex in the graph G^ that is the 1-skeleton of K^ has an even degree, which makes G^ Eulerian, i.e., it is guaranteed to contain an Eulerian tour. Meshes whose edges admit Eulerian tours are crucial in coverage problems arising in several applications including 3D printing and robotics. 
For 2-complexes in R2 (d=2) under mild assumptions (that no two adjacent edges of a 2-cell in K are boundary edges), we show that the Euler transformed 2-complex K^ has a geometric realization in R2, and that each vertex in its 1-skeleton has degree 4. We bound the numbers of vertices, edges, and 2-cells in K^ as small scalar multiples of the corresponding numbers in K. We prove corresponding results for 3-complexes in R3 under an additional assumption that the degree of a vertex in each 3-cell containing it is 3. In this setting, every vertex in G^ is shown to have a degree of 6. 
We also presents bounds on parameters measuring geometric quality (aspect ratios, minimum edge length, and maximum angle) of K^ in terms of the corresponding parameters of K (for d=2,3). Finally, we illustrate a direct application of the proposed Euler transformation in additive manufacturing.
