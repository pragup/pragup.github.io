We propose an Euler transformation that transforms a given d-dimensional cell complex K for d=2,3 into a new d-complex K^ in which every vertex is part of a uniform even number of edges. Hence every vertex in the graph G^ that is the 1-skeleton of K^ has an even degree, which makes G^ Eulerian, i.e., it is guaranteed to contain an Eulerian tour. Meshes whose edges admit Eulerian tours are crucial in coverage problems arising in several applications including 3D printing and robotics. 
For 2-complexes in R2 (d=2) under mild assumptions (that no two adjacent edges of a 2-cell in K are boundary edges), we show that the Euler transformed 2-complex K^ has a geometric realization in R2, and that each vertex in its 1-skeleton has degree 4. We bound the numbers of vertices, edges, and 2-cells in K^ as small scalar multiples of the corresponding numbers in K. We prove corresponding results for 3-complexes in R3 under an additional assumption that the degree of a vertex in each 3-cell containing it is 3. In this setting, every vertex in G^ is shown to have a degree of 6. 
We also presents bounds on parameters measuring geometric quality (aspect ratios, minimum edge length, and maximum angle) of K^ in terms of the corresponding parameters of K (for d=2,3). Finally, we illustrate a direct application of the proposed Euler transformation in additive manufacturing.
